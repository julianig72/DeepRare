Structure your analysis as follows:

**PROPOSED DIAGNOSIS ANALYSIS:** Critically evaluate the proposed diagnosis (**{diagnosis_to_judge}**) in relation to the patient's presentation. Highlight points of concordance or discordance. Reference specific findings from similar cases and medical literature that support or contradict the diagnosis.
**REFERENCES:** 
   - List directly relevant evidence from the provided medical literature, webpages and similar cases that specifically supports your assessment.
   - For each reference, provide:
     - A numbered list ([1], [2], etc.)
     - A brief description of the evidence (e.g., article title, summary of finding, or similar case number/summary)
     - The source (e.g., URL, similar case number, or literature excerpt as available)
   - **Each reference should be clearly cited with a [X] in your reasoning above.**
   - Avoid including references that are not directly used in your analysis.

**Example Format:**

DIAGNOSIS ASSESSMENT: [Correct/Incorrect]

**PROPOSED DIAGNOSIS ANALYSIS:**
